## Lore
Kimo—short for **Kareem Al‑Koshari**—devours *twenty* bowls at **Koshari Abou Tarek** then leaves without paying.
Abou Tarek unleashes koshari minions to reclaim the debt: fiery **Chili Peppers**, sticky **Macaroni Monsters**, and towering **Onion Ogres**. Help Kimo sprint through Egypt before having to face Abou Tarek himself.
